Quickstart for Android

To get started using ARCore with Android, you can run either the hello_ar_kotlin or hello_ar_java sample app included with the ARCore SDK. These sample apps use OpenGL, a programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The apps display any detected planes and allow the user to tap on a plane to place a 3D model.



Set up your development environment
Install Android Studio version 3.1 or higher with Android SDK Platform version 7.0 (API level 24) or higher.

If you are new to Android, see Building your first Android app.

Open a sample project
In Android Studio, clone the ARCore SDK GitHub repository.

There are many ways to do this:

For an established Android Studio installation:

From the Git menu, select Clone.
In the Version control drop-down, select Git as the version control system.
In the URL field, enter the following URL to the ARCore GitHub repository:

https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk.git

You can also open a Terminal and issue the git clone command as follows:


git clone https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk.git
Open one of the sample projects as follows (you must explicitly open a project in order to build and run it).

From the File menu, select Open.
In the arcore-android-sdk/samples folder, select either the hello_ar_kotlin or hello_ar_java folder, and click Open.
